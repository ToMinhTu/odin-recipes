                    <h1>How to Make Hash Browns</h1>
                    <p>Believe it or not, making crispy hash browns is actually quite easy. First, shred your potatoes
                        using
                        your preferred method â€” either with a grater, food processor, or mandoline. Rinse the potatoes
                        until
                        the
                        water is clear, then drain and squeeze out all the remaining liquid (this will ensure the hash
                        browns
                        are extra crispy). </p>
                    <p>Next, you'll add in your binding agents (flour and egg) as well as any other ingredients or
                        seasonings.
                        This recipe only calls for onion, but you could also add cheese, cayenne pepper, or garlic to
                        the
                        mixture. </p>
                    <p>Form your hash browns into patties (either one large hash brown or multiple smaller pancake-like
                        hash
                        browns) and pan fry them in oil, about five minutes on each side. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>How to Make Hash Browns Crispy</h1>
                    <p>To keep your hash browns crispy, make sure to heat the oil to sizzling before adding the patties
                        and
                        wait until the one side is golden brown before flipping.</p>
                    <p>You can also make your hash browns thinner because they will get crispier and cook more evenly.
